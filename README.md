# Invoking a step functions workflow from mobile application built with Amplify and Flutter

In the first part of this series, we built a step functions workflow for a simple apartment booking scenario using the AWS Step functions low code visual editor.

In the second part of this series, we built the same workflow using CDK as IaC, Appsync and python, while invoking the step functions execution from a Lambda function.

In the third part of this series, we built the same workflow using SAM as IaC, Appsync and python, while invoking the step functions execution from a Lambda function.

In this post, we'll be invoking the step functions workflow we created above from a mobile app built with amplify and flutter.a
